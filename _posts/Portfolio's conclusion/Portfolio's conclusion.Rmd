# conclusion :

In conclusion, I have learnt a lot of thing through this seven articles First of all I learned how serotonin had influenced the development of our brain, allowing it to have such a size.
I also learned that there were similarities between chipanzees and humans, particularly in terms of language. Then I learned that evolution could act on any part of the planet and that some species could evolve identically to others while they are geographically separated. And finally I discovered that the biggest factor influencing evolution was the environment, indeed the species change in order to be able to be adapted to it.
